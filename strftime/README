The xcalim program now uses strftime to create dates and time strings.

I include the Net II version here, just in case you don't have it on
your system.

I would guess that it will need some work to make it compile in a
non BSD environment.

The program `ptime' here is a test bed for the strftime routine.
See ../README.install for more information.
