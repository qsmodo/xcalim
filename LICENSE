Fixes/enhancements welcomed....

This is free... however, if you are going to make some profit from this,
then perhaps you should consider passing something back to me since I am
freelance and mostly don't get paid everyday.

Finally, Qsmodo has made several changes to bring up this result, which
modified the strips to resemble a bit more a real calendar. Whatever is
attributed to me in this program, I hereby release under the GNU General
Public License 3. Maybe nothing is, I am no expert on law, so in that
case apply the original license. And enough of this boredom. Have fun!
