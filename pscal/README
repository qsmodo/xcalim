This is a version of the pscal program that pretty prints calendars.
I have modified it to work from xcalim data files stored in ~/Calendar.

If you are in the USA - you might like to edit pscal.script to revert
page translation back to your paper size:

Change:

TRANSLATE="71 -120"

to

TRANSLATE="50 -120"

This has also been worked on by David Kotz who added the -d <directory>
feature and made it work on an old version of the Bourne shell that
doesn't grok shell statements like: shift 5
