* Allow each appointment to have its unique set of countdown alarms. E.g.,
apptt. 1 triggers at -50, -3, 0; apptt. 2 at -10, -5, 0.

* A day 1D day strip view, such as [Ical][1]'s.  At least here the regular
and specific day events must be shown together. This will be though to
implement but ir is a must-have feature for me. 

+ Countdown timer.

+ Put scrollbar when needed in the alarm window.

> Subwidgets on the edit window for selecting alarm times separatedly from
the appointment description.

> Unsensitize Weekly header button when the w shorcut is used.  This is
already done by Help and Memo acts as a toggle.
